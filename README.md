# Timetable-Management-System
Timetable management systems have evolved from manual scheduling to AI-driven automation which really reduce a lot of effort and time, enhancing efficiency and reducing human errors. Python, Tkinter and SQLite Studio  provide a scalable framework for dynamic scheduling and real-time updates regarding faculties, students and their particular subjects. Existing solutions like ASIMUT and FET offer automation but there is lack adaptability due to user interface and not been  user friendly. Our system can stand out by integrating AI-based conflict resolution, chatbot prompting answers, dynamic scheduling, cloud storage, and a user-friendly interface. Future prospects includes AI-driven personalized timetables, ERP/LMS integration, mobile app support, chat bot support, notification alerts, encrypted passwords, OTP verification. By leveraging automation and real-time adaptability, our system ensures better efficiency, accuracy, and user experience compared to traditional methods and solutions currently available in the market.
